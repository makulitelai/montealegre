 <a name="apricot "><h3>Apricot</h3></a>
<p align="justify">Apricot, common name for a tree of
 La, and for its
 the rose family, native of eastern
 fruit. The tree is small, with heart-shaped leaves on
 noar before the
 long stalks . Solitary white flowers appea
 leaves, and the fruit, which resembles the peach, is
 roundish, downy, yellow, and sometimes ruddy on one
 side, white yellow flesh. More than 20 kinds are
 distinguished. Some favorites are Moorpark, of English
 Origin, with a large, round, orange-red freestine,
 ripening in the middle of the season, and Newcastle, of
 California origin, with medium-size round, with a large,
 oblate, yellow red freestine, ready early in the season
 The fruit, Somewhat smaller than a peach, is known for
 its delicate flavor. It is marketed fresh, as well as
 dried and packed, Large quantities are canned or pulped
 for jam making. California and Oregon are the leading
 producers in the United States. It is also significant
 crop in British Columbia (Canada), Australia, Italy, the
 south of France and Israel. </p>

 <a name="rasp"><h3>Raspberry</h3></a>
 <p align="justify">Raspberry, common name for certain
 Dlants of the rose family, and for their ripe, cap-
 shaped fruits, which separate from the floral stalks or
 receptacle when picked. Raspberries are native to the
 North Temperate Zone. The European red raspberry was one
 of the first European plants to be introduced into
 America. The American red raspberry, native to the
 eastern United States, produces fruit that is slightly
 inferior in quality to the European species, although it
 is better suited to the climate of the United States.
 The black raspberry of the Northern United States is
 also hardy and productive. Many varieties of raspberry
 now common in cultivation in commercial and garden
 plantings are derived from the above-mentioned three
 species; their fruits, ranging from black through purple and red to yellow, are used fresh, for home and
Commercial preserving, and for flavors and syrups. The insect enemies of cultivated raspberries include the raspberry sawfly and two cane-boring beetles. The principal diseases of the plant are the virus-caused mosaic leaf yellows, anthracnose, and the raspberry orange 
rust.</p>

 <a name"black"><h3>Blackberry</h3></a>
 <p align="justify">Blackberry, common name for several of the fruits and plants of a genus of the rose family.
 
The ripe fruit is an aggregate of small, purplish-black drupes attached to a cone-shaped receptacle, which readily separates from the plant when the berries are picked. In other members of the genus, the receptacle separates from the drupes and remains on the plant (see Raspberry). More than 24 species of blackberry are known, including several called dewberry and albino varieties called white blackberry. One of the most common species is the sow-teat blackberry. Although the
 blackberry was highly deve l oped as a wild fruit, it was
 rarely grown as a garden fruit until about 1850. Since then, it has been widely cultivated and has become a major commercial crop.</p>


 <a name-"straw"><h3>Strawberry</h3></a>
 <p align="justify">Strawberry, common name for low, perennial herbs of a genus of the rose family,  and also for the edible fruit of these herbs. Strawberries are native to temperate regions throughout the world. All cultivated strawberries were developed from four principal species. The wood strawberry (Fragia vesca) a fragile woodland species native to the mountains of Mexico, South America, and the West Indies. The meadow
 strawberry (F. virginiana) of eastern North America was
 introduced to Europe during the 17th century. The beach
 strawberry (F. chiloensis) is native to the mountainous
 areas in the western hemisphere. The fourth species (F.
 moschata) is common in Central Europe. Most of the
 numerous varieties of strawberries under cultivation
 today were devel oped fron the North American
 varieties . </p>
